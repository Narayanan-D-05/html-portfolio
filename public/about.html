  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Hey there! I’m Narayanan D, a 3rd-year Computer Science student at LICET with a passion for Full Stack Development. I enjoy building things from scratch and watching how everything—from the frontend to the backend—comes together. Outside of code, I love reading books (especially the ones that make me think) and geeking out over animation—from classics to new-age anime. I’ve worked on a few minor projects that helped me get my hands dirty and learn beyond the classroom. I’m constantly inspired by how technology can solve real-world problems and make everyday life better. My goal is to grow into a developer who not only writes clean, efficient code but also builds tools people actually love to use.
